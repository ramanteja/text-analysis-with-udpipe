The app gives insights on the parts of speech for input data based on the language. It also provides display aids like wordcloud, co-occurance graphs, to better understand the underlying data.

#Note:

This takes two input files. The data needs to be in text file and the UDPIPE model file must have the extension ".udpipe".

The URL below contains the sample files.

Include the data and the UDPIPE model of the same language!

The visualisation/processing will only function after the input files are uploaded.
